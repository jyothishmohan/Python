1. Hacking
Description:
Hacking involves gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. Hackers may exploit security vulnerabilities to steal information, disrupt services, or damage systems.

Example:
A hacker breaks into a company's server and downloads customer credit card information, which is then sold on the dark web.

2. Phishing
Description:
Phishing is a form of online fraud where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source, such as a bank or a government agency.

Example:
You receive an email that looks like it’s from your bank, asking you to click a link and enter your login credentials. The link leads to a fake website that steals your information.

3. Identity Theft
Description:
Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal information—like your name, Social Security number, or bank details—and uses it to commit fraud or other crimes in your name.

Example:
A criminal uses your stolen identity to apply for credit cards or take out loans, leaving you responsible for the debt.

4. Ransomware Attacks
Description:
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that locks or encrypts a victim's data. The attacker then demands payment, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for restoring access to the data.

Example:
A hospital’s internal systems are infected with ransomware, making patient records inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker.

5. Cyberbullying
Description:
Cyberbullying involves using digital platforms like social media, messaging apps, or forums to harass, threaten, or embarrass someone, often repeatedly and intentionally.

Example:
A teenager is targeted on social media with hurtful comments, fake rumors, and embarrassing photos, leading to emotional distress.
